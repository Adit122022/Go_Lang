# Learning Go: A Beginner's Journey 🚀

Welcome! This repository is designed to help you learn **Go (Golang)** step-by-step. Go is a powerful language built by Google that is fast, simple, and great for building modern applications.

Whether you are new to coding or coming from another language, follow these steps to master Go.

## 🏁 Step 0: The Beginning (Hello World)

Before diving deep, let's understand what Go is and who built it.

- **What is Go?** It is an open-source language known for its speed and simplicity.
- **Why learn it?** Companies like Google, Uber, and Twitch use it for their massive systems.

� **Start Here:** [Read the Introduction](./Class_00_hello_world/README.md)

> In this module, you will learn about the history of Go, its creators, key features, and run your first "Hello World" program.

## 🔢 Step 1: Simple Values

Computers work with different kinds of values like numbers and text.

- **Basic Types**: Integers (`1`), Floats (`3.14`), Strings (`"Hello"`), and Booleans (`true/false`).
- **Reflection**: How to check what type a value is.

👉 **Explore Code:** [Class_01_simple_values](./Class_01_simple_values)

## 📦 Step 2: Variables & Data Types

Now that we know about values, let's learn how to store them in **Variables**.

- **Variables (`var`)**: Containers for storing data.
- **Constants (`const`)**: Values that never change.
- **Types**: Specific containers for specific data (like `int` for numbers, `string` for text).

👉 **Read the Tutorial:** [Variables & Data Types Guide](./Class_02_DataTypes/Readme.md)

> This guide explains detailed ways to create variables, including implicit vs. explicit declaration, and deep dives into bits and types.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: What's Next?

Once you have mastered the basics above, continue your journey through these topics:

### 🔄 Control Flow

- **[Class_04_Loop](./Class_04_Loop)**: Mastering the `for` loop (Go's only loop!).
- **[Class_05_Conditionals](./Class_05_Conditionals)**: Making decisions with `if/else` and `switch`.

### 📚 Data Structures

- **[Class_06_Arrays](./Class_06_Arrays)**: Fixed-size lists.
- **[Class_07_Slices](./Class_07_Slices)**: Dynamic, flexible lists (The most common list in Go).

### 🏗️ Capstone Project

- **[students_API](./students_API)**: A real-world REST API project to manage student records.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

You need to have Go installed. Check by running `go version` in your terminal.

To run any file in this project, navigate to the folder and use `go run`:

```bash
# Example: Running the Variables lesson
cd Class_02_DataTypes
go run varibles.go
```

Happy Coding! 💻
