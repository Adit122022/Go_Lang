## 🚀 **Introduction**

Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language supported by Google. It is a statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity, high performance, and efficiency, making it ideal for scalable cloud-based systems.

---

## 👥 **History & Creators**

Go was designed at **Google** in 2007 and open-sourced in 2009 by:

- **Robert Griesemer** (Java HotSpot VM)
- **Rob Pike** (Unix, UTF-8, Plan 9)
- **Ken Thompson** (B language, C language, Unix)

> They created Go to address challenges like slow build times, uncontrolled dependencies, and efficient concurrency.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **Simplicity**: Minimalistic syntax that is easy to learn and read.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for **Goroutines** and **Channels**.
- **Performance**: Compiled to machine code, offering performance comparable to C/C++.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management.
- **Strong Standard Library**: "Batteries-included" for networking, HTTP, JSON.
- **Fast Compilation**: Extremely fast build times.

## 📚 **Getting Started**

### Your First Go Program

Save this as `main.go` and run it with `go run main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
